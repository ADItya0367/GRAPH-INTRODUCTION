# GRAPH-INTRODUCTION
GRAPH CONCEPTS

A graph is a non-linear kind of data structure made up of nodes or vertices and edges. The edges connect any two nodes in the graph, and the nodes are also known as vertices.
There are two types of graph
 
DIRECTED GRAPH-in which directions are given 
UNDIRECTED GRAPH- in which directions are not given

edges and vertex are the important things 
if vertex is given then total number of edges will be - |V|*|v-1|/2 - for undirected graph

and for directed graph it will be 
|v|*|v-1|

TYPES OF GRAPH-
Directed unweighted
Directed weighted
Undirected Unweighted 
Undirected weighted
Acyclic Directed
Acyclic Undirected


-------------------------------------------
DEGREE OF A NODE=TOTAL PATH FROM AND TO IT IN CASE OF UNDIRECTED GRAPH

DEGREE OF A NODE =TOTAL PATH FROM IT(INDEGREE) AND TO IT(OUTDEGREE).

TOTAL SUM OF DEGREE=2*|E
